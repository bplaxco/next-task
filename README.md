# next-task

Pick a next task to do

This is an experiment with pulling together todo lists from multiple sources.
I expect the project to be a little hacky.

This isn't really aimed at other people using it at this moment, but I'm adding it
here for the sake of making it easy for me to clone it on different systems and
in case any of the code is useful to someone.

## Supported Sources

### Google: gmail and tasks

This requires a google project set up to generate the `~/.config/next-task/google/credentials.json`,
and the project should have read access to tasks and gmail. The quickstarts for both of these
services should provide enough access.
